# A simple inventory management app built using MERN stack. A take-home challenge for my Software Engineer application to [UBX.ph](https://ubx.ph).

## Challenge given description

Create a simple inventory management backend app using NodeJS Express. It’s up to you what kind of business this is – you could be selling groceries, cars, or anything. Your inventory app should have categories and items, so when the user goes to the home-page they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. You should include all of the CRUD methods for both items and categories, so anybody that’s visiting the site can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.
